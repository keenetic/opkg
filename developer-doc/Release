Releasing opkg
==============

## Release location

http://downloads.yoctoproject.org/releases/opkg/

## Release proceedure

1)  Update NEWS, adding an entry to the top of the file detailling changes from
    the last release. Commit this change.

2)  Update the version number in configure.ac. Commit this change.

3)  Tag the previous commit with the new version number, prefixed with 'v', eg.
    'v0.3.0'. Use 'git tag -s' to produce a signed tag so that the release can
    be trusted.

4)  Run './autogen.sh && ./configure' to prepare the source tree.

5)  Run 'make dist'. This will generate 'opkg-$VERSION.tar.gz'.

6)  Sign the generated file using 'gpg -sab opkg-$VERSION.tar.gz'.

7)  Write release notes (probably copy pasta from NEWS) into the file
    'opkg-$VERSION.release-notes'.

8)  Add these files to the release directory. If a local copy of the release
    directory doesn't exist, clone it from the public URL listed above using
    wget.

9)  Update sums files by running 'md5sum opkg-* > MD5SUMS',
    'sha1sum opkg-* > SHA1SUMS' and 'sha256sum opkg-* > SHA256SUMS' in the
    release directory.

10) Upload the new files to the release location on the Yocto Project download
    server.

11) Update the opkg project page at 'http://code.google.com/p/opkg/' to link to
    the new release.

12) Announce the release by email to 'opkg-devel@googlegroups.com'.
